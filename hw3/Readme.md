It's a multi-thread  dqn implementation for game Breakout-v0 and MsPacman game.
In detail, the implementation includes replay buffer and target network. The sampling scheme is designed as epsilon-greedy where epsilon decays at a certain rate.
The result of Breakout-v0 is not satisfying, though there is some trend of reward increasing.
The result of MsPacman is good.
The graph below is the performance of Breakout-v0

I tried to implement policy gradient on CartPole and Pong-v0.

In Carpole, it works well. After 300 episode, it gets around 200.
This the screen shot from tensorboard:

In Pong-v0, I only work out a easy version. In my code folder, file test.py is able to get slowly increasing episode reward.
The plot below plots the growing trend of first 200 episodes.
